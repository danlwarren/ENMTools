#' Takes an overlap matrix and a tree and runs permutation tests to
#' determine the statistical significance of the relationship between
#' overlap and time
#'
#' @param clade An enmtools.clade object containing species data and a phylogeny
#' @param env Environmental layers for use when overlap is calculated using niche models.
#' @param overlap.source The source of the overlaps to calculate.  Choices are "bc", "dm", "gam", "glm", "mx", "range", and "point"
#' @param nreps A number of reps to do
#' @param f The model to be used for GLM and GAM comparisons
#' @param overlap.matrix A matrix of overlaps to use, for option overlap.source = "matrix"
#' @param metric The overlap metric to use. For ENM sources, this can be any combination of "D", "I", "cor", "env.D", "env.I", and "env.cor".
#' for range and point overlap this argument is ignored.
#' @param ... Arguments to be passed to modeling functions for ENM-based overlaps.
#'
#' @return A list containing a data frame of coefficients from the empirical regression of overlap on time along with the coefficients from all Monte Carlo replicates, along with plots and p values for the accompanying statistical tests.
