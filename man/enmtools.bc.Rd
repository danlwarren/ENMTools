\title{Takes an emtools.species object with presence and background points, and builds a Bioclim model}
\usage{
enmtools.bc(
  species,
  env = NA,
  test.prop = 0,
  report = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  nback = 1000,
  env.nback = 10000,
  rts.reps = 0,
  bg.source = "default",
  verbose = FALSE,
  clamp = TRUE,
  corner = NA,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{An enmtools.species object}

\item{env}{A raster or raster stack of environmental data.}

\item{test.prop}{Proportion of data to withhold randomly for model evaluation, or "block" for spatially structured evaluation.}

\item{report}{Optional name of an html file for generating reports}

\item{overwrite}{TRUE/FALSE whether to overwrite a report file if it already exists}

\item{nback}{Number of background points for models. In the case of bioclim models these are only used for evaluation.}

\item{env.nback}{Number of points to draw from environment space for environment space discrimination metrics.}

\item{rts.reps}{The number of replicates to do for a Raes and ter Steege-style test of significance}

\item{bg.source}{Source for drawing background points.  If "points", it just uses the background points that are already in the species object.  If "range", it uses the range raster.  If "env", it draws points at randome from the entire study area outlined by the first environmental layer.}

\item{verbose}{Controls printing of various messages progress reports.  Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{clamp}{When set to TRUE, clamps the environmental layers so that predictions made outside the min/max of the training data for each predictor are set to the value for the min/max for that predictor. Prevents the model from extrapolating beyond the min/max bounds of the predictor space the model was trained in, although there could still be projections outside the multivariate training space if predictors are strongly correlated.}

\item{corner}{An integer from 1 to 4.  Selects which corner to use for "block" test data.  By default the corner is selected randomly.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to bioclim()}
}
\value{
An enmtools model object containing species name, model formula (if any), model object, suitability raster, marginal response plots, and any evaluation objects that were created.
